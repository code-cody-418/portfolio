        <h1>HI, I'M CODY</h1>
      </div>
      <p>I'm a passionate software developer who loves to build applications. Early in my
        career I found how writing code can help people and companies achieve their goals. This mentality of
        building software for people is what drives me in my career. Some of my specialties include building fullstack
        web applications, ETL pipelines, 3rd party data integration, and administering cloud applications with a focus
        on DevOps.

      <h2>Employers</h2>

      <h3>Navajo Nation Government</h3>
      <p>Senior Programmer Analyst</p>
      <p>With the Navajo Nation I led a team of developers, conducted a data transfer, rebuilt the department website,
        and maintained VM infrastructure. My primary responsibility was spearheading a fullstack recruitment
        application. While building the application I wrote authentication code, maintained docker images, led scrum
        meetings, and performed code reviews. Furthermore, my initiative saved the department $60k by successfully
        transferring over 2 million records to a new database in a short time. The data was extracted into CSV,
        transformed using JavaScript, and then loaded using the database GUI. Additionally, I rebuilt our website using
        modern css and frameworks to create a mobile responsive site. The website project also included changing static
        html with dynamic data. This automation saved one employee four hours a day. Also, a search bar was added that
        could filter jobs allowing a better user experience. Lastly, throughout my employment I delivered various
        improvements to the servers and running services, including creating backups, upgrading software, and
        configuring web servers.</p>

      <h3>Gesture</h3>
      <p>Software Engineer</p>
      <p>At Gesture my primary duties included developing the codebase with various api endpoints, configuring docker
        for dev environment, refactoring the codebase, and pushing code to production. One primary object was building
        multiple ETL pipelines for data syncing between our databases to multiple CRM’s. By utilizing an express server
        I was able to build out api endpoints that would interact with CRM webhooks. These endpoints could then be
        deployed, utilizing Google Firebase functions, along with triggers that watched for record changes in the
        database. Overall, the synchronized databases allowed for other departments to manage data with ease. Lastly, I
        built api endpoints that would interact with the Stripe library rest api’s. This endpoint was part of the
        ecommerce product that would charge users.</p>

      <h3>Central New Mexico Community College - Ingenuity, Inc.</h3>
      <p>Assistant Development Instructor</p>
      <p>At this bootcamp I taught students how to build Web Applications using a modified MERN Stack. Other tools shown
        to students included git and Docker. With this stack and tools I helped students successfully create full blown
        web apps. Students were also taught how to build RESTful api’s, as well as how to develop data-downloader’s to
        store external API data.</p>

      <h3>Freelance</h3>
      <p>Web Developer</p>
      <p>My job was building web applications to meet my clients needs. Clients had various requirements including both
        frontend and backend requests. One client focused on 3d websites, which were created using threeJS. These sites
        consisted of walking characters and environments. One project also required multiple users to be in one room, so
        socket.io was utilized to create a server with UDP sockets that allowed multiple users to wander around a room
        together. On the other hand, I worked with a client to build a backend that utilized Google Firebase. With this
        client my focus was creating endpoints with CRUD operations for a NoSQL database.</p>

      <h3>Dine College</h3>
      <p>Web Design Instructor</p>
      <p>Taught students how to design and build websites using HTML and CSS. Prepared lesson plans with video lectures.
